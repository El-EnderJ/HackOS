# Partition table for HackOS – ESP32 4 MB Flash
#
# @file partitions.csv
# @brief Custom partition layout optimised for maximum application space.
#
# Flash chip: 4 MB (0x400000).  The first 36 KB (0x0000–0x8FFF) is reserved
# for the ESP32 second-stage bootloader and partition-table sectors; the
# entries below cover the remaining addressable space.
#
# OTA dual-slot has been removed to reclaim space for the application
# binary.  OTA can be re-enabled later once further optimisation frees
# enough room for two firmware slots.
#
#   - nvs      :  20 KB  – Non-volatile storage (Wi-Fi credentials, settings)
#   - app0     :   3 MB  – Factory firmware
#   - spiffs   : 960 KB  – LittleFS user data (data/ directory)
#
# Column order: Name, Type, SubType, Offset, Size, Flags
# Name,   Type, SubType,  Offset,   Size,  Flags
